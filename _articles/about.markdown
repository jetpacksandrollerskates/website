## Who am I?

Blake Stevenson, the brains behind Jetpacks and Rollerskates. A Canadian designer, illustrator and printmaker. His playful style is unique and influenced by 1980s and 90s pop culture. In his work he features a wide range of eclectic characters, odd geometry and an interesting perspective on gravity. Blake builds worlds with thoughtful narratives for his characters to play in.
