Stranger Things is one of those shows that comes around once a decade. The story and style came together as a perfectly packaged piece of nostalgia from the golden age of media. Where every new piece of content came with a toy, lunchbox, collectable glassware; pretty much whatever your licensing heart could desire.

When approached to create a piece of art for the upcoming Netflix Presents: Visions from the Upside Down coffee table book, it was a dream come true. The brief was wide open, so the gut reaction was to present a showdown between good and evil. Focusing on Eleven and the Demogorgon.

The book was published by Printed in Blood, Del Ray and Randomhouse. 

## Process

When Jumping into these sorts of projects, layout is a huge focus. Trying to strike the right balance and composition through a series of rough sketches that are constantly reworked and rearranged. Continuously layering on the previous drawings to better render with each pass.
