I hold the [Sketch design software](https://www.sketch.com/) in a very special place in my heart. As a UX/UI designer, it was the first piece of design software that felt like it was truly built for digital layout. Early on (Sketch v2 and early release of v3) I became a pretty big advocate, I developed tips and tricks for it and even taught a number of workshops. It was a pioneer in the user experience/interface software world.

Sketch approached me because they knew I used the software daily for my UX/UI work and background as an illustrator. The first question they asked was “Have you ever illustrated in Sketch before?” and I quickly responded with “Never! Maybe the odd complex icon here and there.” They then asked if I would be interested in giving it a try as an experiment. The end goal would be to create a limited edition silk screened poster for the community. We would document it and report back in the form of a blog post.

This idea sounded pretty awesome. The UX designer in me jumped at the opportunity to critique and take notes on a piece of software I held in such high regard. Especially if it was to bend its limits to do something I never thought it could do. 

## Documentation

The process wasn’t just documented. I screen recorded the entire creation, built a journey map and took a bunch of notes. We even got a detailed photo journal from the printing company ([Mama Sauce](https://www.mamas-sauce.com/), one of the best in the industry). If you want to see more detailed information on the process you can go over to the [Sketch blog](https://www.sketch.com/blog/2019/10/14/from-sketch-to-screen-how-blake-stevenson-created-our-ambassador-art-print/) and see the whole post.

## Capturing the whole process

The video was sped up significantly. The poster, notes, meetings and all took between 8 - 15 hours of time. Much longer than expected but overall I think we got a pretty solid piece of content out of it.
