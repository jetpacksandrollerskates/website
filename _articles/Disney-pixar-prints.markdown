## WALL•E and EVE Limited Edition Print Set.

What can be said about Disney/Pixar that hasn’t been said already. Probably the number one gateway drug for anyone wanting to get into the creative arts. I cannot tell you how exciting it was to be approached by one of Disney’s licensing partners to do a handful of  limited edition silkscreen prints.  

It began with one of the representatives reaching out in regards to some posts they had seen on instagram. A rough but stylized drawing of WALL•E the robot posted about a year prior. They asked if the piece could be cleaned up and made into a set, accompanied by EVE (the other main character in the Pixar films).

## Alice in Wonderland Limited Edition Print.

After WALL•E and EVE was completed, they asked “If you could develop a piece for an older disney property, what would it be?” This was one of the hardest questions. It’s like asking a parent to pick a favorite child. Eventually Alice in Wonderland was decided upon. The sheer chaos, rich visuals and infinite imagination was definitely one of the films that completely shaped many peoples creative minds.
