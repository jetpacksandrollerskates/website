I have been wanting to try out the time-lapse feature on Procreate. Usually, I just ink my work digitally but I wanted to take something from the sketch to final. Time-lapse is a very interesting feature but a bit too lightweight for what I was looking for. I see how they are utilizing the redo/undo feature to make a time-lapse video, which is cool but when I see an artist process I would prefer a screencast. I love it when IU can see all the tools an designer or artist is using and how they use it. The best part about tools like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator is that thereâ€™s a number of different ways to do the same thing and I love getting that insight through screencasts.

## How to access the time-lapse feature 

![Procreate time-lapse ui](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=[1cCALRxBPuZeRe8Be89hspwp9IDvwjYIS])

1. Tap the **wrench** icon in the top left hand corner of Procreate.
2. Select the **video** icon.
3. Tap the **Time-lapse Replay** 
4. Once you're in time-lapse replay you can now scrub back and fourth on the screen to rewind and fast forward through your creation. Pretty straight forward.
